
- What are the three different modes in which we can operate Hive?
	> THERE ARE 3 MODES
		>> STANDALONE : LOCAL
		>> PSEUDO-DISTRIBUTED MODE : SINGLE NODE
		>> FULLY DISTRIBUTED MODE : MULTIPLE NODE

- WHAT IS A CONTAINER?
	> CONTAINER REPRESENTS AN ALLOCATED RESOURCE IN THE CLUSTER. 
	> THE RESOURCEMANAGER IS THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO ALLOCATE ANY CONTAINER TO APPLICATIONS. 
	> THE ALLOCATED CONTAINER IS ALWAYS ON A SINGLE NODE AND HAS A UNIQUE CONTAINERID. 
	> IT HAS A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF RESOURCE ALLOCATED.
	> IT REPRESENTS A RESOURCE (MEMORY) ON A SINGLE NODE AT A GIVEN CLUSTER.
	> A CONTAINER IS
		> SUPERVISED BY THE NODE MANAGER
		> SCHEDULED BY THE RESOURCE MANAGER


- HOW CAN YOU IDENTIFY FAILURES IN NAME NODE?
	> THROUGH HEARTBEATS

- HOW CAN YOU IDENTIFY FAILURES IN DATA NODE?


- COMPARE BETWEEN ROW-COLUMNAR & COLUMNAR FILE FORMATS? WHICH FORMAT IS PREFERRED FOR FREQUENT OR HEAVY ANALYTICAL QUERIES?
	> COLUMNAR FORMAT IS PREFERRED / COLUMNAR NOSQL DB

- WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ORDER BY AND SORT BY?
	> ORDER BY:	USES 1 REDUCER EVEN IF WE EXPLICITLY CONFIGURE FOR MORE THAN 1 REDUCERS
		     	ORDER THE DATA GLOBALLY
	> SORT BY:	ORDER DATA BASED ON NUMBER OF REDUCERS CONFIGURED
			LOCALLY SORTED FOR EACH REDUCER
- WHY YOU SHOULD NOT USE 1 REDUCER TO PROCESS DATA?

- WHAT IS PARTITIONING ? 
	> PARTITIONING IS A WAY OF DIVIDING A TABLE INTO RELATED PARTS BASED ON THE VALUES OF PARTICULAR COLUMNS LIKE DATE, CITY, AND DEPARTMENT.

- WHICH COLUMN SHOULD BE USED FOR PARTITIONING ?
	> COLUMNS USED TO FILTER DATA FREQUENTLY
	> AVOID PRIMARY KEYS
	> LESS UNIQUENESS

- WHICH PARTITIONING BETWEEN STATIC AND DYNAMIC PROVIDE BETTER PERFORMANCE?
	> STATIC PARTITIONING - FAST
	> DYNAMIC PARTITIONING	- SLOW, AS HIVE HAS TO SCAN THROUGH THE ENTIRE DATASET

- BENEFITS OF PARTITIONING
	> ITS HELPS TO ORGANIZE THE DATA IN LOGICAL FASHION 
	> IMPROVE PERFORMANCE: AND WHEN WE QUERY THE PARTITIONED TABLE USING PARTITION COLUMN, IT ALLOWS HIVE TO SKIP ALL BUT RELEVANT SUB-DIRECTORIES AND FILES. THIS CAN LEAD TO TREMENDOUS REDUCTION IN DATA REQUIRED TO READ AND FILTER IN THE INITIAL MAP STAGE. THIS REDUCES THE NUMBER OF MAPPER, I/O OPERATION AND RESPONSE TIME FOR THE QUERY
